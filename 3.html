<h2>Dissociative disorders</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215" target="_blank" title="Dissociative Disorders Definition">Dissociative disorders</a> are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. <br>People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.
<br>Dissociative disorders usually develop as a reaction to trauma and help keep difficult memories at bay. <br><strong>Symptoms</strong> — ranging from <u>amnesia</u> to <u>alternate identities</u> — depend in part on the type of dissociative disorder you have. Times of stress can temporarily worsen symptoms, making them more obvious.
<br>Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication. Although treating dissociative disorders can be difficult, many people learn new ways of coping and lead healthy, productive lives. </p>
