<h2>Suicide</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" target="_blank" title="Suicide Definition">Suicide</a> is the act of intentionally causing one's own death.<br> Depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse — including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines — are risk factors. <br>Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.<br> Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide — such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; proper media reporting of suicide; and improving economic conditions. <br>Even though crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness.
The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. <br><strong>Common methods</strong> of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicides resulted in 828,000 global deaths in 2015, an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990. This makes suicide <strong><u>the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.</strong></u> </p>
