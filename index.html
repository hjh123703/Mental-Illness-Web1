<h1>Depression</h1>
  <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression" target="_blank" title="Depression Definition">Depression (major depressive disorder)</a> is a <strong>common and serious <u>medical illness</u> </strong>that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable.
  <br>Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.
<p><br>  <strong><u>Depression symptoms</strong></u> can vary from mild to severe and can include:
<br><br>
    -Feeling sad or having a depressed mood<br>
    -Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed<br>
    -Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting<br>
    -Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much<br>
    -Loss of energy or increased fatigue<br>
    -Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)<br>
    -Feeling worthless or guilty<br>
    -Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions<br>
    -Thoughts of death or suicide<br> </p>

Symptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression
Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.

<p>Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.</p>
